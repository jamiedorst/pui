## Notes

1. Items added to cart are not persistent due to the restrictions on the assignment (need some sort of local storage, which is part of the assignment for 6B)
2. For the purposes of this assignment, I reused the same image four times for pillows other than Couch Pillow (because it is very hard to find open source, high quality images of these types of pillows). Images still change based on color, there is just only one image repeated four times on the page.

## Extra Credit

1. Wishlist: N/A
2. Carousel: N/A
3. Interesting and Useful JavaScript Functionality: I'm not sure what counts as "interesting and useful" but I did a lot of work to actually utilize React components to reduce code repitition and make more functionality, which was all very new and useful to me, and was technically outside of the scope of the assignment
4. Product Pages for All Products: All product pages are accessible and have interactive options and shopping cart functionality
