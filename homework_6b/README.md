## Notes

1. Items added to cart are persistent across pages until reload (fulfills assignment requirements) and the total prices update accurately as well (plus tax)
2. For the purposes of this assignment, I reused the same image four times for pillows other than Couch Pillow (because it is very hard to find open source, high quality images of these types of pillows). Images still change based on color, there is just only one image repeated four times on the page.

## Extra Credit

1. Wishlist: Implemented, added below Cart. Users can click on any product page to add it to their wishlist. A banner pops up to show them that they added it and they can navigate to the cart page to see it. On the cart page, users can see their cart, and below, their wishlist. From there, users may add wishlist items to their cart or remove them completely.
2. Carousel: N/A
3. Interesting and Useful JavaScript Functionality: I'm not sure what counts as "interesting and useful" but I did a lot of work to actually utilize React components to reduce code repitition and make more functionality, which was all very new and useful to me, and was technically outside of the scope of the assignment.
4. Product Pages for All Products: All product pages are accessible and have interactive options and shopping cart functionality
